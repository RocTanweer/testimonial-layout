## For curious people ðŸ˜Š

- I used [semantic html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) elements for accessibility and SEO.
- Since the project does not include any main heading or heading of any particular testimonial, I have used &lt;h&gt; elements and hide them ðŸ˜‰
- I made sure that the project is fully responsive.
